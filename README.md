# Solana Mobile dApp Scaffold
The Solana Mobile dApp scaffold is a respository template providing fast and efficient way for developers to build decentralized mobile applications on the Solana blockchain. With the scaffold, developers can quickly set up and get started with building their Solana mobile dApp. The scaffold includes pre-built components integrated with features, such as wallet connection, airdrop SOL(DEVNET/TESTNET), sign messages and send transactions.
Scaffold follows clean architecture and MVVM principles, enabling efficient and robust mobile app development.

Believe me, [There is no better time to build consumer mobile dApps.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=There%20is%20no%20better%20time%20to%20build%20consumer%20mobile%20dApps.%0a%0aStart%20building%3A%20&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcdhiraj40%2Fmobile-dapp-scaffold%2F)
